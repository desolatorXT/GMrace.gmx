- Upgrade HUD
- New enemy projectiles, laset shot.
- Õew ¡… patterns
- Credits room
- Vertical scrolling test room.
- 2player co-op mode

- IMPORTANT! I think there is a memory leak with the menus (the instances are not being consistently destroyed when the menu closes). Look into it.
- Also make a sprite for the restart option in the game over menu.
- Can we make the auras use the same sprite, just colorize it? This seems ridiculous... Also WTF are the _default sprites???
